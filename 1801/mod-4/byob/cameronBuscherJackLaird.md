# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/JackLaird0/leafage-backend/blob/d3a820b7bd0797297056cd6a9ccba99c5d17f57e/server.js#L77-L98)

This query endpoint which can also serve as a general GET request if no query is present. Was super satisfying to find the answer because we had basically given up until Cameron asked a random guy on runescape. He helped.
* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/JackLaird0/leafage-backend/blob/d3a820b7bd0797297056cd6a9ccba99c5d17f57e/server.js#L35-L47)

This was sad because after we implemented it it broke Jack's postman, but it's still awesome code.

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
